### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on adding to the unblocked games section and making sure nothing is blocked by the schools. I'm also additionally porting some things to the site from w3spaces (it got blocked sadly)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning advanced mathematics and new coding things whenever I don't know something
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about things to add to the site and more
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: d.tsarddakas@gmail.com or +1(315)570-1013

This site is called LINK-D because it's a page with links and my name is Demetrius (Demarcus nickname)
Heavy development is always underway in some form or another
This was originally hosted on w3schools but it got blocked sadly as a malware/proxy. I will do different now and make sure that Lightspeed can't detect anything.
Ways to prevent Lightspeed from detecting things would be to only include links to the games instead of the games directly, not including any proxies (they are commonly blocked), and more.
Basically anything that you see on the Lightspeed block page as the category is something to avoid carefully.
