 This is a guide for the movies at school feature. <a href="./movie2.html">Go back?</a><br>
<br>
1. Ensure that you are at <a href="./movie2.html">movie2.html</a>.<br>
2. If you are on a school device, do not fear that it has been blocked. If it doesn't display the block screen immediately then it is not blocked.<br>
3. On school devices, wait for a while or refresh a lot for the site to load. This is not my fault, but the device's fault. If you were on a home device, it would probably load instantly.<br>
4. If you are not on a school device, then contact me at <a href="mailto:d.tsarddakas@gmail.com">d.tsarddakas@gmail.com</a>.

Note: The service goes down every so often as to not alert Lightspeed (thingy that blocks websites) of its existence
