    INFORMATION ON AN "AS-IS" BASIS. CREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO WARRANTIES<br>
    REGARDING THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS<br>

<br>
Statement of Purpose<br>
<br>
The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer<br>
exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator<br>
and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of<br>
authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").<br>
<br>
Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for<br>
the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and<br>
scientific works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without fear<br>
of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other<br>
works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever<br>
and for any purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes.<br>
These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free<br>
culture and the further production of creative, cultural and scientific<br>
works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in<br>
part through the use and efforts of others.<br>
<br>
For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any<br>
expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person<br>
associating CC0 with a Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she<br>
is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily<br>
elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its<br>
terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the<br>
Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights.<br>
<br>
1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be<br>
protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and<br>
Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not<br>
limited to, the following:<br>
<br>
  i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display,<br>
     communicate, and translate a Work;<br>
 ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);<br>
iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or<br>
     likeness depicted in a Work;<br>
 iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,<br>
     subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;<br>
  v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data<br>
     in a Work;<br>
 vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the<br>
     European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal<br>
     protection of databases, and under any national implementation<br>
     thereof, including any amended or successor version of such<br>
     directive); and<br>
vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the<br>
     world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national<br>
     implementations thereof.<br>
<br>
2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention<br>
of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently,<br>
irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of<br>
Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes<br>
of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as<br>
future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories<br>
worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or<br>
treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future<br>
medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever,<br>
including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional<br>
purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each<br>
member of the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and<br>
successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to<br>
revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal or<br>
equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public<br>
as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.<br>
<br>
3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason<br>
be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the<br>
Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into<br>
account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the<br>
extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected<br>
person a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive,<br>
irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and<br>
Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the<br>
maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future<br>
time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number<br>
of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without<br>
limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the<br>
"License"). The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was<br>
applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the License for any<br>
reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such<br>
partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder<br>
of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she<br>
will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related<br>
Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of<br>
action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's<br>
express Statement of Purpose.<br>
<br>
4. Limitations and Disclaimers.<br>
<br>
 a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,<br>
    surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.<br>
 b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or<br>
    warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied,<br>
    statutory or otherwise, including without limitation warranties of<br>
    title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non<br>
    infringement, or the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or<br>
    the present or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to<br>
    the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.<br>
 c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons<br>
    that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without<br>
    limitation any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work.<br>
    Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary<br>
    consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the<br>
    Work.<br>
 d. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a<br>
    party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to<br>
    this CC0 or use of the Work.<br>
