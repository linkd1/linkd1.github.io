 Are you looking to donate? There are two(ish) ways!
 <br>
 1. <a href="https://ko-fi.com/movieweb">Donate to movie section (doesn't go to owner of this site, goes to movie-web team. If you're looking to donate to me directly, use option 2)</a>
 <br><br>
 2. You can join the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/YdR6RgvUkW">LINK-D Discord</a> (the button above the unblocked games button) and press 'Server Subscriptions' when you're in the server (must not be on a school device since Discord is blocked on them). You can then buy from 3 tiers of subscriptions giving you benefits in the server like exclusive chats. Please inform me once you've subscribed so I can give you a role for it, the thingy screwed up on me. Also, a side note, any donations would make my dad proud of me...
<br><br>
On a side note, I thought I might as well add this, I'm willing to do people's homework for some extra cash. I'm trying to scrape whatever I can for a ton of things (i.e. book publishing)<br> </center></body>
